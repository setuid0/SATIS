Repo for the Security Analyst Threat Intelligence System Virtual Image (release TBD but shooting for July 1st 2013)


This repo will contain a number of threat research and threat intelligence tools. Think of it as BackTrack/Kali or the SANS SIFT Kit but focused on threat intellignece gathering and analysis.

Tools to be included:

Maltego CE
Malformity 
Cuckoo Sandbox
CIF
Something Hadoopish or other big data analytics. 

If you'd like to see something included, or would like to assist, send a request to cshaffer [at] g-m-a-i-l. com

This will be meant for a mobile deployment. Obviously if you are going to do a deploymnet of system you want to build it out for such. I will include sizing recommendations where possible.
