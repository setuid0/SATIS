Repo for the Security Analyst Threat Intelligence System Virtual Image (release TBD but shooting for July 1st 2013). Students of the Advanced Threat Intelligence course  (http://www.trainace.com/courses/threat-intelligence/) will recieve a custom version to use in the class. That version will be functional for all of the items covered in the class, with the exceptions of necessary APIs or licenses, so they can put the VM to work as soon as they are back on the job and have proper permission!


This repo will contain a number of threat research and threat intelligence tools. Think of it as BackTrack/Kali or the SANS SIFT Kit but focused on threat intellignece gathering and analysis.

Tools to be included:

Maltego CE
Malformity 
Cuckoo Sandbox
CIF
Something Hadoopish or other big data analytics. 

If you'd like to see something included, or would like to assist, send a request to cshaffer [at] g-m-a-i-l. com

This will be meant for a mobile deployment. Obviously if you are going to do a deployment of such system, especially for an enterprise,  you want to build it out for such. I will include sizing recommendations where possible.
